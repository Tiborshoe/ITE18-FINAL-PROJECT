**Tic Tac Toe Game Project**

**GROUP DEVELOPERS**


**ABOUT OUR GAME PROJECT**

Our Tic Tac Toe project is a classic implementation of the well-known game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. 
The goal is to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before their opponent does. 
This game offers a simple yet engaging experience that combines strategy and fun.

**OBJECTIVES**

1. To create an interactive and user-friendly version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
2. To practice and enhance our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. To understand and implement game logic in a web-based application.
4. To learn how to manage project files and structures effectively.

**Story**

The Tic Tac Toe game is a timeless classic that has entertained players of all ages for generations. 
Our goal was to recreate this game for the web, adding modern design elements and responsive features to make it enjoyable for everyone. 
While working on this project, we collaborated to solve challenges, build intuitive user interfaces, and optimize the game's functionality.
